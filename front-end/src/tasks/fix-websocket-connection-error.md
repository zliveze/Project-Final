# Fix WebSocket Connection Error on Vercel

- [x] Investigate WebSocket connection failure: `wss://backendyumin.vercel.app/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=websocket' failed`
- [x] Check backend WebSocket configuration (`main.ts` reviewed, `events.gateway.ts` reviewed)
- [x] Check Vercel deployment configuration (`vercel.json` reviewed, backend environment variables need user verification)
- [x] Check frontend WebSocket connection setup (`config.ts`, `.env`, `UserReviewContext.tsx` reviewed. `EventsContext.tsx` likely similar)
- [x] Ensure backend allows connections from the frontend domain on Vercel (`FRONTEND_URL` env var verified by user, `back-end/vercel.json` updated by Cline).
- [x] User committed `back-end/vercel.json` changes, pushed, triggered backend redeployment. Issue persisted.
- [ ] Updated `UserReviewContext.tsx` to explicitly set WebSocket URL and path. User to commit, push, redeploy frontend, and test.
