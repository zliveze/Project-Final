# Toast Notification Standardization

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to standardize toast notifications across the application.

## Changes Made

1. **Created a centralized toast utility**
   - Created `front-end\src\utils\toast.ts` with standardized functions for different types of toast notifications
   - Implemented consistent styling and behavior for all toast types

2. **Updated components to use the standardized toast utility**
   - LoginForm.tsx
   - RegisterForm.tsx
   - ForgotPasswordForm.tsx
   - ResetPasswordForm.tsx
   - VerifyEmail.tsx
   - ProductInfo.tsx

3. **Ensured consistent toast container configuration**
   - Updated DefaultLayout.tsx to include a standardized ToastContainer
   - Added theme="light" to ensure consistent appearance

4. **Removed duplicate toast containers**
   - Removed ToastContainer from individual pages:
     - login.tsx
     - register.tsx
     - forgot-password.tsx
     - reset-password.tsx
     - verify-email.tsx
     - profile/index.tsx
     - product/[slug].tsx

5. **Created documentation**
   - Created `front-end\src\docs\toast-notifications.md` with detailed usage instructions
   - Created this summary document

## Benefits

1. **Consistent User Experience**
   - All toast notifications now have the same appearance and behavior
   - Positioning, timing, and styling are consistent across the application

2. **Simplified Development**
   - Developers can use simple utility functions instead of remembering configuration options
   - Reduced code duplication

3. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Changes to toast styling or behavior can be made in one place
   - No need to update multiple components when making changes

## Next Steps

1. **Continue standardization**
   - Update remaining components that use toast notifications
   - Ensure all new components use the standardized utility

2. **Consider advanced features**
   - Custom toast components for more complex notifications
   - Theme-aware toast styling

3. **Monitor and refine**
   - Gather user feedback on toast notifications
   - Make adjustments as needed
